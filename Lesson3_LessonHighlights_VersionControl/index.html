            </h2>
            <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Version control is a system through which many different
versions of a file or many different
files and their different versions are stored and organized.
Version control is important because it allows multiple people to work on
the same file at the same time while a previous
version of the file still exists in its last saved state as a back-up.
So no longer are files lost or changed beyond recognition to no longer be
able to be recovered because with version control all saved
versions are backed up and organized. In turn version control is
very beneficial towards all kinds of programming and buisness. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a valuable resource in the field of data storage. A remote repository is a separate location that data and files are stored and organized. It is based away from the individual computer that the file/data was created on. It should be understood that individual computers are not fail-proof and there are complications and failures within the system so remote repositories become great places to store files and data because computers can break down, systems may crash, or computers can be stolen. In all these scenarios if there is no data and file back-ups in place in a remote repository then all the work stored on that computer may possibly be lost forever.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a great resource to have for software developers because it provides a system and language through which many different versions of a file can be worked and edited on by many different people. By providing a means of version control, GIT allows for more of a team collaborative effort on projects within an industry or business so that the final version may be completed in a faster time. Also GIT provides for a distributed work flow process in which a project may develop into different versions that may be deleted or followed through with so that a final version is the best option that provides the best result. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> GitHub is a web-based service that utilizes the GIT software to build up a remote repository through the web. The benefits of using GitHub are numerous. GitHub not only allows itself to be a version control system but also to manage and control code. GitHub also is beneficial because it provides a web based repository that can be accessed anywhere by any computer that has a solid internet connection. Another great reason for using GitHub is the fact that it is a free system available  to anyone online that has a good connection to the internet and really wants to have a remote back up of files and code.   </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository
                </span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A local repository is a place in the local system in which data is stored. Typically it can be considered the local cache or within the hard drive. A local repository is a good asset to have when coding and creating files because everything is stored offline and so it is always accessible from the local system. But because it is stored on a local system/computer it provides for some horrendous events. Systems can crash, Computers can be stolen, and data can possibly be compromised  by an unauthorized breach. So it should be understood that backing up data in a separate  location is ideal.   </p>
